The svelte compiler, rewritten in Rust.

This project may never finish. I've just got the bug and I'm gonna be at this for a while.

I will begin from the compile function and a noop compiler that compiles an empty svelte file to an empty js bundle,
and incrementally enable it to compile more svelte features.
